                "Tras el ajuste de hiperparámetros, se observa una mejora notable en el rendimiento de los modelos basados en técnicas de boosting frente a los métodos tradicionales como el árbol de decisión y el Random Forest. En concreto, los modelos AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost y LightGBM alcanzan precisiones en el conjunto de test superiores al 90 %, superando ampliamente las obtenidas por los modelos iniciales.\n",
                "\n",
                "Entre ellos, XGBoost destaca como el modelo con mayor precisión global (92,5 %), mostrando un excelente equilibrio entre sesgo y varianza, lo que lo convierte en la mejor opción si se busca maximizar el rendimiento predictivo. Por otro lado, AdaBoost presenta un comportamiento especialmente estable, con una diferencia mínima entre las métricas de entrenamiento y test (0,9 %), lo que refleja una gran capacidad de generalización y un bajo riesgo de sobreajuste. El modelo Gradient Boosting mantiene también un rendimiento muy competitivo y se consolida como una alternativa robusta y más fácilmente interpretable.\n",
                "\n",
                "En conjunto, los resultados confirman que las técnicas de boosting, y en particular XGBoost, son las más adecuadas para este problema de clasificación binaria de diabetes, combinando alta precisión, estabilidad y adaptabilidad a las características del conjunto de datos empleado (668 registros, 6 variables predictoras y 1 objectivo)."
