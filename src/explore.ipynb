En concreto, los modelos AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost y LightGBM alcanzan precisiones en el conjunto de test superiores al 90 %, superando ampliamente las obtenidas por los modelos iniciales.\n",

Por otro lado, AdaBoost presenta un comportamiento especialmente estable, con una diferencia mínima entre las métricas de entrenamiento y test (0,9 %), lo que refleja una gran capacidad de generalización y un bajo riesgo de sobreajuste. El modelo Gradient Boosting mantiene también un rendimiento muy competitivo y se consolida como una alternativa robusta y más fácilmente interpretable.\n",
